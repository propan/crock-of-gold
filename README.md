# crock-of-gold

a demo application to support my talk at ClojureFinland meetup

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run-dev` \*
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

\* `lein run-dev` automatically detects code changes. Alternatively, you can run in production mode
with `lein run`.
